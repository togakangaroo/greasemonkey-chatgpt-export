# ChatGPT Conversation

**User**: in greasemonkey, how would I make a `@match` clause that made a script run on all of the following
- https://chat.openai.com/chat?model=text-davinci-002-render-sha
- https://chat.openai.com/chat
- https://chat.openai.com/chat#here

and anything else that fits that pattern?

**ChatGPT**: In Greasemonkey, you can use the `@match` metadata rule to specify on which URLs your user script should run. To match all the given URLs and anything else that fits the pattern, you can use a wildcard `*`. Here's how to write the `@match` rule for your case:



```perl
`// ==UserScript==
// @name         Your Script Name
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      0.1
// @description  Your script description
// @author       Your Name
// @match        https://chat.openai.com/chat*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==
`
```



The `@match` rule `https://chat.openai.com/chat*` will match all the URLs you provided and any other URL that starts with `https://chat.openai.com/chat`.
